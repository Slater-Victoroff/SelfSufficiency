Acceptable temperature range determined by ASHRAE standard 55. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASHRAE_55

Under this model, since air speeds above 0.2 m/s are accounted for differently, we shall keep airspeeds below
0.2 m/s to avoid any discomfort brought by extreme movement speed, but we must account for humidity as we
have much less control over it.
